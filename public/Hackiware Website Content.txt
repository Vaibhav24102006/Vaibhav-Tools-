About Us : 
Hackiware was founded in 2023 with a simple yet powerful idea—born in a small room but driven by a vision to create a big, meaningful impact in the cybersecurity ecosystem.
Established by Yash Sharma (Founder), Student of BCA in Cyber Security Specialization, and Himanshu Sharma (Co-Founder), Student of BTech in AI & ML, Hackiware began as a passion-driven initiative to spread cybersecurity awareness, practical knowledge, and ethical responsibility among students and emerging professionals. What started as a modest concept has steadily evolved into a growing platform dedicated to strengthening digital security education and community engagement.
With a clear mission to empower the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, Hackiware focuses on delivering industry-relevant learning, hands-on exposure, and impactful initiatives that bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
Today, Hackiware stands as a testament to how vision, commitment, and collaboration can transform a small beginning into a movement aimed at shaping a safer and more secure digital future.
Our Story
Hackiware was initialized through a series of discussions and planning calls, shaped within the confines of a small room and driven by a strong purpose—to create cybersecurity awareness across schools and educational institutions. What began as an idea to conduct awareness sessions soon took a structured form with the vision to organize impactful initiatives such as the KAVACH event.
As the initiative gained momentum and recognition, Hackiware evolved beyond individual efforts and transformed into a structured organizational environment. This transformation marked the beginning of a focused approach toward delivering scalable cybersecurity education, collaborative events, and community-driven programs.
